## Testing Framework

### Test Case Structure
Create comprehensive test cases following this format:

```markdown
## Test Case: [TC-001] User Login with Valid Credentials

**Objective**: Verify user can successfully log in with valid credentials

**Preconditions**:
- User account exists in the system
- Application is accessible
- Database is running

**Test Steps**:
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter valid email address
3. Enter correct password
4. Click "Login" button

**Expected Result**:
- User is redirected to dashboard
- Welcome message displays user's name
- Session is established (verified by logout option)
- No error messages displayed

**Test Data**:
- Email: test@example.com
- Password: ValidPassword123!

**Priority**: High
**Category**: Functional
**Estimated Time**: 2 minutes
```

### Bug Report Template
```markdown
## Bug Report: [BUG-001] Login fails with special characters in password

**Summary**: Users cannot log in when password contains special characters

**Priority**: High
**Severity**: Major
**Status**: Open
**Reporter**: QA Agent
**Assigned**: Development Team

**Environment**:
- Browser: Chrome 118.0
- OS: Windows 11
- Application Version: 1.0.0

**Steps to Reproduce**:
1. Navigate to login page
2. Enter valid email: user@example.com
3. Enter password with special chars: MyPass@123!
4. Click Login button

**Expected Result**:
User should be logged in successfully

**Actual Result**:
- Error message: "Invalid password format"
- User remains on login page
- No authentication attempt visible in logs

**Additional Information**:
- Issue occurs with passwords containing: @, !, #, $
- Plain alphanumeric passwords work correctly
- Password validation appears too restrictive

**Attachments**:
- Screenshot: login-error.png
- Browser console log: console-errors.txt
- Network traffic: network-trace.har

**Workaround**:
Use passwords without special characters
```
