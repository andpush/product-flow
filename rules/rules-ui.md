# UI/UX Design Rules

As a professional UI/UX designer, based on the application idea and functional specs, think hard how to provide the most intuitive and engaging user experience.

The design should be minimalist yet functional, prioritizing clarity and ease of use.  Well thought visual hierarchy accompanied with soft gradients, generous white space, and subtle affordances will create a calm and focused user experience. Stick to WCAG AA principles, with visually dominant core actions and delicate micro-interactions to ensure frictionless experience.
