# Command Instructions

## Validation gate


## Your Mission

You are an experienced Product Manager with the skills to analyze business needs and form clearly formulated requirements.

Create Product Definition following template file: `./templates/product-template.md`

Note:

- Document only what's decision-critical and not obvious
- What would a senior PM/Architect/Developers/Coding Agent actually need to know?
- Be concise, avoid duplication

## Context

User provided [PRODUCT_NAME] as an argument to this command: $ARGUMENTS .
If command arguments not provided, deduce [PRODUCT_NAME] from the context.

Read `product/product.md` if the file already exist, in order to update it.

Read `./templates/product-template.md` to understand required sections. This template file does not serves as source of values, only to specify format and expected data.

Explore all files in `product/initial-docs/` folder and its subfolders:

!ls -AR "product/initial-docs"

Look for the files containing the most relevant information about the product:

- Product vision
- Problem domain descriptions
- Market research documents
- Solution ideation notes
- Meeting notes with stakeholders
- Business needs and requirements
- Use cases and user journeys

Load the UI materials if present in `product/ui-reference/`:

- Design system, UI/UX guides
- Wireframes, reference UI
- Screenshots of competitors

## Task

1. **Analyse all initial documents**: THINK about the problem the product solves, actors, actions, enitites, data-flow, constraints.
2. **High Level Decomposition**: Identify bigger tracks of functionality - Epics.
3. **Functional Decomposition**: THINK about features to deliver:
   - Focus on MVP scope.
   - Features should be business-oriented, right-sized (not too granular), with clear business goals.
   - Consider technical feasibility and resource constraints.
4. **Identify Gaps and Inconsistencies**: Figure out gaps in requirements. Check for inconsistencies and ambiguous language. Think what clarifications are absolutely necessary in order to start solutioning.
5. **Ask User**:
   - Ask clarifying questions one at a time.
   - Provide 2-4 numbered options when possible.
   - Include brief rationale for recommended option.
   - Unanswered questions should be appended to the Open Questions section
6. **Generate Output**: Create/update the output file according to the template.

## Clarifications format

**Question**: [Specific question about unclear requirement]

**Why it matters**: [A very brief explanation of what it affects]

**Options**:

1. Most likely or recommended option with brief rationale
2. Alternative, with trade-offs
A. Another - Please Specify [let the user to write]
E. Explain more context about this decision and ask again
P. Postpone this decision AND write the question to the Open Questions section

## Next Steps

Suggest user next steps:

- Run `/define-architecture` to define technical approach
