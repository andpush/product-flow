### Definition of Ready

- [ ] All acceptance criteria are clear and testable
- [ ] UI/UX requirements are defined
- [ ] Technical approach is understood
- [ ] Dependencies are identified and resolved
- [ ] No critical open questions remain
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable

**Next Steps**:

1. Create UI mockups with `/mockup-feature [FEATURE_ID]`
2. Create implementation plan with `/plan-feature [FEATURE_ID]`
[FEATURE_ID] can be specified as file path to the feature folder.

## Template Usage Instructions

1. **Feature ID Format**: Use consistent naming like `F001-FeatureName`
2. **Be Specific**: Use concrete examples and measurable criteria in acceptance criteria
3. **Think User-First**: Focus on the end user value and experience
4. **Include Edge Cases**: Don't just focus on happy path - consider error scenarios
5. **Keep Testable**: Ensure all acceptance criteria can be verified objectively

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Vague Acceptance Criteria**: Avoid subjective terms like "fast", "easy", "intuitive"
- **Technical Implementation Details**: Focus on what, not how (save how for planning phase)
- **Scope Creep**: Clearly define what's in and out of scope
- **Missing Error Handling**: Include error scenarios and edge cases
- **Forgetting Accessibility**: Always consider accessibility requirements
