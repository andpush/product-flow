# Architecture Definition

| Created | Last Updated | Status |
|---------|--------------|--------|
| [YYYY-MM-DD]  | [YYYY-MM-DD] | [Draft/Complete] |

## Executive Summary

[Write 2-3 sentences describing the overall technical approach and key architectural decisions]

## Core Principles

1. **KISS (Keep It Simple)** - Choose proven, well-documented solutions over cutting-edge
2. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)** - Build only what's needed for MVP, evolve incrementally
3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Establish reusable patterns and shared components
4. **Fail Fast** - Quick feedback loops, automated testing, early error detection
5. **Security by Design** - Security considerations integrated from the start

## System Architecture

[Visualize architecture with the help of (1) High Level Design - component  diagram, (2) Data Flow Diagram, (3) Sequence or Activity Diagram or BPMN - choose which is more appropriate to the domain, (4) Entity Relationship Diagram (from business perspective), (5) State diagram (if state machine is at the heart of functionality and state flow is important)]

### High-Level Design

[An example of components diagram:]

```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[Client Application] --> LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> API[API Server]
    API --> Auth[Authentication Service]
    API --> BL[Business Logic Layer]
    BL --> Data[Data Access Layer]
    Data --> DB[(Primary Database)]
    Data --> Cache[(Cache Layer)]
    API --> External[External APIs]
```

### Sequence diagram

[Sequence diagram ]

### Data flow diagram

[Data Flow diagram]
