# Product Discovery

Complete product discovery combining lean startup methodology and user research.

## Validated Learning

- Test hypotheses with data, not opinions
- Fail fast and cheaply
- Trust behavior over statements
- When 3+ users mention it ‚Üí it's a pattern

## MVP Thinking

- Minimum experiment to validate assumptions
- Not a crappy version - strategically minimal
- Build to learn, not just to ship

## Assumptions & Validation

### Assumption Types

| Type | Question | Risk Indicators |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Value** | Will customers find this valuable? | Requires behavior change, novel solution |
| **Growth** | Will the product grow? | Unproven acquisition channel |
| **Feasibility** | Can we build this? | Complex tech, regulatory unknowns |

### Hypothesis Format

```markdown
We believe [customer segment] experiences [problem]
and that [solution] will [outcome/benefit].

We will know we're right when [measurable signal].
```

### Pre-Implementation Validation Checklist

- [ ] Riskiest assumptions tested
- [ ] Evidence of customer demand
- [ ] Prototype tested with users
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Scope is truly minimal

### Validation Methods (by cost/speed)

| Method | Cost | Duration | Good For | When |
|--------|------|----------|----------|------|
| **Customer Interviews** | Time only | 1-2 weeks | Problem validation | Before anything |
| **Landing Page** | $100-500 | 1-2 days | Demand signals | After problem validation |
| **Mockup Testing** | $200-500 | 3-5 days | UX validation | Before development |
| **Wizard of Oz** | Low upfront | 1-2 weeks | Workflow validation | Before automation |
| **MVF** | High | 1-2 weeks | Real usage | After problem/solution validation |

### Interviews (5-10 users)

**Extract & Prioritize:**

- **Frequency**: How many mentioned it?
- **Intensity**: How painful? ("annoying" vs "deal-breaker")
- **Urgency**: How soon needed?
- **Willingness to Pay**: Would they pay to solve it?
- **Pattern = 3+ users mention unprompted**
- **Prioritize = Frequency √ó Intensity**

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk = Must Validate:**

- Requires user behavior change
- No proven market
- Complex technology/integration
- Regulatory uncertainty
- Unproven business model

**Questions identifying risks:**

- What must be true for this to work?
- What could cause complete failure?
- Which assumptions have most uncertainty?
- Which, if wrong, would be most costly?

### On each Feature

- Feature goal (problem + value)
- User stories
- UI/UX requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Identify Assumptions:

   ```markdown
   ## Assumptions to Validate
   - **[Assumption]**
   - Validation: [Method]
   - Success: [Criteria]
   - Priority: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
   ```

### On each Update Feature iteration

1. Analyze Changes:
   - Compare with previous product.md
   - Check for new files (feedback, research)
2. Incorporate Research:
   - Extract patterns from feedback/testing
   - Update requirements based on validated learnings
   - Mark assumptions as ‚úÖ validated / ‚ùå invalidated
   - Adjust acceptance criteria
3. Document:

   ```markdown
   ## Research-Driven Changes
   ### [Activity] (Date)
   - **Finding**: [Learning]
   - **Impact**: [Change]
   - **Updated**: [What changed]
   ```

## MVP Scope Management

**Include:** Core problem solver, minimum value, enables learning, technically feasible

**Defer:** Nice-to-haves, optimizations, secondary segments, features requiring MVP learnings

**Right-size large scope:**

- Which 3-4 criteria validate core hypothesis?
- What's the 20% delivering 80% of learning?

## Pivot or Persevere

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Hypothesis disproven | **Pivot** |
| Wrong problem / wrong segment | **Pivot** |
| Can't find acquisition channel | **Pivot** |
| Hypothesis validated | **Persevere** |
| Metrics improving | **Persevere** |
| PMF indicators emerging | **Persevere** |

**Pivot Types:** Zoom-in/out, customer segment, customer need, platform, business model, channel
