# Product Discovery

Complete product discovery combining business analysis, lean startup methodology, and user research.

## When to Activate

- Commands: `/define-product`, `/add-feature`, `/add-mvp-features`, `/update-feature`
- Files: `product.md`, `feature.md`
- Context: requirements, validation, assumptions, user research, feedback, MVP

## Core Principles

### Business Value First

- Focus on "what" and "why", not "how"
- Business-oriented features, not technical tasks
- Each feature delivers clear value
- Right-sized: not too granular, not too broad

### Validated Learning

- Test hypotheses with data, not opinions
- Fail fast and cheaply
- Trust behavior over statements
- When 3+ users mention it ‚Üí it's a pattern

### MVP Thinking

- Minimum experiment to validate assumptions
- Not a crappy version - strategically minimal
- Build to learn, not just to ship

## Requirements Definition

### User Stories

```tempate
As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [business value]
```

### Acceptance Criteria

- Specific and testable
- Happy path + key edge cases
- Clear definition of "done"
- Given-When-Then format when helpful

### Gap Analysis Checklist

- [ ] User personas / target audience defined
- [ ] Success metrics / business goals clear
- [ ] Error handling / edge cases specified
- [ ] Security / compliance requirements documented
- [ ] Performance expectations defined
- [ ] User roles / permissions clarified
- [ ] Integration requirements listed
- [ ] Data model / entities understood

### Asking Clarifying Questions

```markdown
**Question**: [Specific question]
**Why it matters**: [1-sentence impact]
**Options**:
1. [Recommended option] - [Rationale]
2. [Alternative] - [Trade-offs]
A. Another approach - Please specify
P. Postpone (add to Open Questions)
```

## Assumptions & Validation

### Assumption Types

| Type | Question | Risk Indicators |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Value** | Will customers find this valuable? | Requires behavior change, novel solution |
| **Growth** | Will the product grow? | Unproven acquisition channel |
| **Feasibility** | Can we build this? | Complex tech, regulatory unknowns |

### Hypothesis Format

```markdown
We believe [customer segment] experiences [problem]
and that [solution] will [outcome/benefit].

We will know we're right when [measurable signal].
```

### Pre-Implementation Validation Checklist

- [ ] Riskiest assumptions tested
- [ ] Evidence of customer demand
- [ ] Prototype tested with users
- [ ] Success metrics defined
- [ ] Scope is truly minimal

### Validation Methods (by cost/speed)

| Method | Cost | Duration | Good For | When |
|--------|------|----------|----------|------|
| **Customer Interviews** | Time only | 1-2 weeks | Problem validation | Before anything |
| **Landing Page** | $100-500 | 1-2 days | Demand signals | After problem validation |
| **Mockup Testing** | $200-500 | 3-5 days | UX validation | Before development |
| **Wizard of Oz** | Low upfront | 1-2 weeks | Workflow validation | Before automation |
| **MVF** | High | 1-2 weeks | Real usage | After problem/solution validation |

### Interviews (5-10 users)

**Extract & Prioritize:**

- **Frequency**: How many mentioned it?
- **Intensity**: How painful? ("annoying" vs "deal-breaker")
- **Urgency**: How soon needed?
- **Willingness to Pay**: Would they pay to solve it?
- **Pattern = 3+ users mention unprompted**
- **Prioritize = Frequency √ó Intensity**

### Risk Assessment

**High Risk = Must Validate:**

- Requires user behavior change
- No proven market
- Complex technology/integration
- Regulatory uncertainty
- Unproven business model

**Questions identifying risks:**

- What must be true for this to work?
- What could cause complete failure?
- Which assumptions have most uncertainty?
- Which, if wrong, would be most costly?

## Documentation Templates

### Product Definition Template

When creating or updating `product/product.md`, follow the structure in [product-template.md](../../templates/product-template.md).

### Feature Definition Template

When creating feature definitions in `product/features/`, follow the structure in [feature-template.md](../../templates/feature-template.md).

### On each Feature

- Feature goal (problem + value)
- User stories
- UI/UX requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- Identify Assumptions:

   ```markdown
   ## Assumptions to Validate
   - **[Assumption]**
   - Validation: [Method]
   - Success: [Criteria]
   - Priority: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW
   ```

### On each Update Feature iteration

1. Analyze Changes:
   - Compare with previous product.md
   - Check for new files (feedback, research)
2. Incorporate Research:
   - Extract patterns from feedback/testing
   - Update requirements based on validated learnings
   - Mark assumptions as ‚úÖ validated / ‚ùå invalidated
   - Adjust acceptance criteria
3. Document:

   ```markdown
   ## Research-Driven Changes
   ### [Activity] (Date)
   - **Finding**: [Learning]
   - **Impact**: [Change]
   - **Updated**: [What changed]
   ```

## MVP Scope Management

**Include:** Core problem solver, minimum value, enables learning, technically feasible

**Defer:** Nice-to-haves, optimizations, secondary segments, features requiring MVP learnings

**Right-size large scope:**

- Which 3-4 criteria validate core hypothesis?
- What's the 20% delivering 80% of learning?

## Pivot or Persevere

| Signal | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Hypothesis disproven | **Pivot** |
| Wrong problem / wrong segment | **Pivot** |
| Can't find acquisition channel | **Pivot** |
| Hypothesis validated | **Persevere** |
| Metrics improving | **Persevere** |
| PMF indicators emerging | **Persevere** |

**Pivot Types:** Zoom-in/out, customer segment, customer need, platform, business model, channel
