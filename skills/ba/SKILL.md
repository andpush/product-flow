# Business Analysis

Perform Business Analysis as a senior BA based on the business needs and requirements and come up with clear features decomposition.

## Core Principles

### Business Value First

- Focus on "what" and "why", not "how"
- Business-oriented features, not technical tasks

## Functionality Decomposition

### Epic

**Strategic initiative or large functionality unit**:

- Substantial business value with measurable KPIs
- Multiple sprints/releases
- Independent from other epics (parallel development)
- Groups related features
- Example: `Self-service portal`, `GDPR compliance`

### Feature

**Deliverable capability**:

- Independently releasable
- Contains Functional Requirements
- May contain User Stories
- Has Acceptance Criteria
- Example: `Password reset`, `CSV export`

### User Story

**User-facing scenario**:

```
As a [role], I want to [capability], so that [value]
```

Use for: user interactions with clear personas

### Functional Requirements

**Explicit rules & specs** for technical/non-user-facing functionality:

- Business logic, validations, data models
- API contracts, security constraints
- Use structured format (YAML/JSON) for complex specs

### Acceptance Criteria

**Testable conditions** defining "done" for Features, Stories, and FRs:

- Format: `Given [context], When [action], Then [outcome]`
- Cover: happy path + edge cases + errors + performance
- Must be specific, measurable, verifiable

### Product Definition Checklist
