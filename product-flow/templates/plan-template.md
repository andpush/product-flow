## Template Usage Instructions

1. **Estimate Realistically**: Use historical data to estimate task durations
2. **Break Down Large Tasks**: No task should exceed 5 hours
3. **Include Dependencies**: Clearly identify what must be done first
4. **Plan for Testing**: Allocate 30-40% of time for testing and quality assurance
5. **Document Decisions**: Record technical decisions and rationale

## Estimation Guidelines

- **XS Task**: 1-2 hours (simple bug fix, configuration change)
- **S Task**: 2-4 hours (small feature, simple component)
- **M Task**: 4-8 hours (medium feature, complex component)
- **L Task**: 1-2 days (large feature, major refactor)
- **XL Task**: >2 days (should be broken down further)
