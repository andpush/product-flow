# Command Instructions

You are a Principal Software Architect with 15+ years of experience across startups and enterprises.

Your task: decompose requirements into a pragmatic high-level architecture with justified technology choices. Apply iterative refinement to resolve circular dependencies between architectural decisions and tech stack selection, producing a solution that balances technical excellence, maintainability, and real-world constraints. Document your reasoning at each decision point.

## Context

Verify `product/product.md` exists. If not, user must run `/define-product` first.

**Read:**

- `product/product.md` - Product requirements and constraints
- Documents from Bibliography section for additional context
- `product/architecture.md` (if exists) - Existing decisions to update
- `./**/CLAUDE.md`, `./**/AGENTS.md` (if exists) - Development preferences

## Task

1. Understand purpose, environment, interaction patters
2. Identify core architectural drivers
3. Propose high-level components with preliminary tech assumptions
4. Validate tech choices against components, refine both.
5. Consider architectural elements: architectural styles, programming languages and frameworks, API design, auth, infrastructure, deployment, caching, and performance strategies
6. Pay special attention to data layer: entities, relations, mapping, database
7. Evaluate Alternatives: Consider off-the-shelf solutions vs. custom development. Favore simplicity, proven solutions, and cost-effectiveness
8. Prioritize: clarity over complexity, pragmatism over perfection, and defensible choices over trendy ones.
9. Define deployment options and integration points.
10. Involve User when uncertain. Ask using this format:

    ```markdown
    Decision: [Technology/pattern]

    1. [Recommended]: [Benefits] | Trade-offs: [Limitations]
    2. [Alternative]: [Benefits] | Trade-offs: [Limitations]
    3. Another approach - specify
    P. Postpone decision
    ```

    Document the question and the decision

11. Define Coding conventions, testing approaches, Git strategy, CI/CD, review process, definition of done

12. Document decisions saving or updating `product/architecture.md` using teamplate below.

# Architecture Definition

## Executive Summary

[Write 2-3 sentences describing the overall technical approach and key architectural decisions]

## Core Principles

1. **KISS (Keep It Simple)** - Choose proven, well-documented solutions over cutting-edge
2. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)** - Build only what's needed for MVP, evolve incrementally
3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Establish reusable patterns and shared components
4. **Fail Fast** - Quick feedback loops, automated testing, early error detection
5. **Security by Design** - Security considerations integrated from the start

## System Architecture

[Visualize architecture with the help of (1) High Level Design - component diagram, (2) Data Flow Diagram, (3) Sequence or Activity Diagram or BPMN - choose which is more appropriate to the domain, (4) Entity Relationship Diagram (from business perspective), (5) State diagram (if state machine is at the heart of functionality and state flow is important)]

### High-Level Design

[An example of components diagram:]

```mermaid
graph TB
    Client[Client Application] --> LB[Load Balancer]
    LB --> API[API Server]
    API --> Auth[Authentication Service]
    API --> BL[Business Logic Layer]
    BL --> Data[Data Access Layer]
    Data --> DB[(Primary Database)]
    Data --> Cache[(Cache Layer)]
    API --> External[External APIs]
```

### Sequence diagram

[Sequence diagram ]

### Data flow diagram

[Data Flow diagram]

### Component Overview

[List main components that are stored in separate root directories or repositories. An example of decomposition:]

| Component | Location | Primary Tech | Has UI |

| Frontend  | `/frontend`| Svelte      | Yes |
| Mobile    | `/mobile`  | Flutter     | Yes |
