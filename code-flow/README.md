# Code Tools Plugin

Essential development tools for code quality, security, and testing.

## Skills

### security-reviewer
Perform comprehensive security audits using SAST tools (Semgrep, Bandit, npm audit, Trivy) combined with AI analysis. Generate structured vulnerability reports with severity ratings (CR/HI/ME/LO), file references, code snippets, impact analysis, and remediation guidance.

**Use when:**
- Security audit or vulnerability scan needed
- Before production releases
- During compliance audits
- Assessing legacy codebases

### codebase-explorer
Systematically explore and document codebases at three levels: Quick Scan (tech stack), Deep Analysis (architecture), and Comprehensive Audit (quality, security, performance).

**Use when:**
- Exploring unfamiliar codebases
- Understanding legacy systems
- Preparing for refactoring
- Onboarding to new projects
- Architecture documentation needed

### test-generator
Generate comprehensive unit tests with technology stack awareness. Auto-detects testing frameworks (Jest, pytest, RSpec, PHPUnit, Go testing, JUnit, Flutter/Dart), generates context-aware test cases, measures coverage, and provides actionable insights.

**Use when:**
- Creating tests for untested code
- Analyzing test coverage
- Improving code quality
- Setting up test infrastructure
